        "\n",
        "Wow, growth hacking *and* upselling all in the same article? Also Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Okay, let's start at the beginning. Imagine the following scenario: You're responsible for increasing the amount of money users spend on your e-commerce platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "You and your team come up with different measures you could implement to achieve your goal. Two of these measures could be:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Provide a discount on your best-selling items,\n",
        "- Implement a rewards program that incentivices repeat purchases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both of these measures are fairly complex with each incurring a certain, probably known, amount of cost and an unknown effect on your customers' spending behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "To decide which of these two possible measures is worth both the effort and incurred cost you need to estimate their effect on customer spend.\n",
        "\n",
        "A natural way of estimating this effect is computing the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\textrm{avg}(\\textrm{spend} | \\textrm{treatment} = 1) - \\textrm{avg}(\\textrm{spend} | \\textrm{treatment} = 0) = \\textrm{ATE}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially you would compute the average spend of users who received the treatment (received a discount or signed up for rewards) and subtract from that the average spend of users who didn't receive the treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without discussing the details of the underlying potential outcomes framework, the above expression is called the average treatment effect (ATE).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Let's estimate the average treatment effect and make a decision!\n",
        "\n",
        "So now we'll just analyze our e-commerce data of treated and untreated customers and compute the average treatment effect (ATE) for each proposed measure, right? Right?\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you rush ahead with your ATE computations - now is a good time to take a step back and contemplate how your data was generated in the first place(data-generating process).\n",
        "\n",
        "## References and further material ...\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we continue: My example here is based on a tutorial by the authors of the excellent DoWhy library. You can find the original tutorial here:\n",

        "Imagine we observe the monthly spend of each of our 10,000 users over the course of a year. Each user will spend with a certain distribution (here, a Poisson distribution) and there are both high and low spenders with different mean spends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the course of the year, each user can sign up to our rewards program in any month and once they have signed up their spend goes up by 50% relative to what they would've spent without signing up.\n",
        "\n",
        "So far so mundane: Different customers show different spending behaviour and signing up to our rewards program increases their spend.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now the big question is: How are treatment assignment (rewards program signup) and outcome (spending behaviour) related? \n",
        "\n",
        "If treatment and outcome, interpreted as random variables, are independent of one another then according to the potential outcome framework we can compute the ATE as easily as shown above:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\textrm{ATE} = \\textrm{avg}(\\textrm{spend} | \\textrm{treatment} = 1) - \\textrm{avg}(\\textrm{spend} | \\textrm{treatment} = 0)$\n",

        "When are treatment and outcome independent? The gold standard for achieving their independence in a data set is the randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n",
        "\n",
        "In our scenario what an RCT would look like is randomly signing up our users to our rewards program - indepndent of their spending behaviour or any other characteristic.\n",
        "\n",
        "So we would go through our list of 10,000 users and flip a coin for each of them, sign them up to our program in a random month of the year based on our coin, and send them on their merry way to continue buying stuff in our online shop.\n",

Further, they visit our shop more frequently hence are more likely to notice our new rewards program and the signup page.
